# tipping-points-replication

This repo replicates and extends "[Tipping and the Dynamics of Segregation](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/123/1/177/1889797)" by Card, Mas, and Rothstein (2008), fitting a simple Bayesian regression for tipping dynamics to measure uncertainty in parameter estimates.
